Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for developing a personalized idea-tracking dashboard. The system aims to capture, organize, refine, and track ideas through to the creation of Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), leveraging gamification to enhance user motivation and progress monitoring.

1.2 Scope
This dashboard will be a web-based application hosted on Vercel. It will collect voice and text inputs, process ideas using a first-principles-based "super prompt," and visualize progress through dynamic analytics inspired by GitHub's contribution squares and real-time data graphs.

2. Objectives
Provide a seamless platform for users to capture ideas via voice and text.
Implement a systematic workflow for filtering and refining ideas into MVPs.
Incorporate gamification elements to boost user engagement.
Visualize idea progress and user activity through dynamic analytics.
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Idea Capture
Voice Input: Allow users to submit ideas through voice recordings, which are transcribed into text.
Text Input: Provide a text field for users to input ideas manually.
3.2 Idea Processing
Super Prompt Analysis: Utilize a first-principles-based "super prompt" to analyze and refine submitted ideas.
Filtering Mechanism: Implement criteria to prioritize ideas based on feasibility, impact, and user interest.
3.3 Idea Tracking
Progress Stages: Track ideas through stages like Conceptualization, Refinement, Development, and MVP Completion.
Dynamic Analytics: Display user activity and idea progression using visuals inspired by GitHub's contribution squares and real-time graphs.
Gamification Elements: Include badges, points, or rewards to motivate continuous user engagement.
3.4 User Interface
Dashboard Overview: Present a summary of all ideas, their statuses, and user achievements.
Detail View: Provide detailed insights and next steps for each idea.
Responsive Design: Ensure the dashboard is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Performance
Scalability: The system should handle increasing numbers of users and data without performance degradation.
Reliability: Ensure high availability with minimal downtime.
4.2 Security
Data Protection: Secure user data during transmission and storage using encryption.
Authentication: Implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
4.3 Usability
User-Friendly Interface: Design intuitive navigation and clear calls to action.
Accessibility: Comply with WCAG standards to make the dashboard accessible to all users.
5. Technical Requirements
Hosting Platform: Deploy the application on Vercel for scalability and performance.
Frameworks: Use Next.js with the App Router for front-end development.
Backend Services: Implement serverless functions for processing and data handling.
Database: Utilize a scalable database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing ideas and user data.
APIs and Integrations:
Integrate speech-to-text services for voice input transcription.
Use real-time data visualization libraries for dynamic analytics.
Third-Party Libraries:
Incorporate shadcn/ui for UI components.
Use Lucide React for icons.
6. User Stories
6.1 Idea Submission
As a user, I want to submit ideas via voice so that I can capture thoughts quickly.
As a user, I want to input ideas through text to elaborate on my concepts.
6.2 Idea Management
As a user, I want to view all my ideas in one place to track their progress.
As a user, I want to prioritize ideas based on potential impact.
6.3 Gamification
As a user, I want to earn badges for milestones to stay motivated.
As a user, I want to see visual representations of my activity to monitor my engagement.
7. Timeline
Phase 1 (2 weeks): Requirements Gathering and Planning
Phase 2 (3 weeks): Design and Prototyping
Phase 3 (5 weeks): Development
Phase 4 (2 weeks): Testing and Quality Assurance
Phase 5 (1 week): Deployment and Launch
